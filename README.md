# Stock-Price-Prediction
📈 Stock Market Regression using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates stock market prediction using regression models implemented in Python via Google Colab. The goal is to analyze historical stock price data and build predictive models to forecast future prices.

🧠 Overview
Problem Statement: Predict future stock prices based on historical data using regression techniques.

Tools Used: Google Colab, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Techniques: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge/Lasso Regression (optional)

🚀 Features
Load and preprocess historical stock market data (CSV format).

Visualize stock trends and feature correlations.

Train and evaluate regression models.

Plot predictions vs. actual stock prices.

Easily editable and reproducible via Google Colab.

🔗 How to Run
Click the button below to open the notebook in Google Colab:

Upload your stock data CSV file or use sample datasets.

Run the cells step-by-step to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

📝 Notes
This is a basic demonstration and doesn't account for external market factors like news, economic indicators, etc.

For advanced use-cases, consider using LSTM or ARIMA models.
